# Gunner

Gunner is a simple Gleam language code runner that allows users to execute Gleam code snippets easily and efficiently.

You need Nushell to use it! You activate it using `source gunner.nu`

## Quick start

```
# nushell is required
git clone https://github.com/hara/gunner.git
source ./gunner/gunner.nu
gunner init
gunner run examples/hello.gleam
gunner add gleam_erlang
gunner run examples/erlang-only.gleam
gunner gleam deps list
```

## Here are some of its key functionalities:

* running Gleam code snippets `gunner <gleam_file>` without creating a gleam project
* adding packages to the runner `gunner add <package>` (can also add multiple packages at once)
* running with Erlang or JS targets (in the "sandbox") `gunner <gleam_file> --js`
* formatting Gleam code `gunner format <gleam_file>`
* builds the sandbox "runner" using docker `gunner init` optional: `gunner init <package1> <package2> ...` (e.g. `gunner init gleam_erlang gleam_otp`)
* allows running `gleam` directly inside the sandbox `gunner gleam deps list` (this can result in unexpected behavior)
* it uses a volume to cache the dependencies and parts of the build

## Why this?

I wanted a quick and easy way to run Gleam code snippets while learning and demonstrating Gleam. The [Gleam Tour](https://tour.gleam.run/) is great but can't add packages. It also seems not to be "up to date" with the latest Gleam features.

## Why "Gunner"?

**G**leam R**unner** and because you can shoot your foot with it.

## Why "Nushell"?

I like Nushell, and it allows me to quickly create a custom command with flags and parameters, help and completions.
